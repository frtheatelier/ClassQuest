## Introduction
A prototype python game that incorporates a few interactive puzzle to get children thinking.

## Puzzles
### Fruit slider
> Use the arrow keys to more puzzle pieces into the empty slot. Do so in order to get the final image!

Fruit Slider aims to aid young children in forming synaptic connections about the different types of fruits.

### Word chain
> Create a word that starts with the last letter of the previous word! Any words is allowed as long as it hasn't been fone before (and it is a valid word)

This game is meant to develop children's language vocabulary in a fun way. By competing against a bot or another person, it'll hopefully be a good way to motivate children to learn learn more of the language.

## How to run the game
1. Go to `main.py` and run the game
2. Press the required keys to go through the game.

## Further ideas
- More puzzles focusing on other areas of child cognitive development such as arithmetics, deductive logic, ethics and diversity, etc
- Better graphics
